## Project Justification
The below datasets can be combined to score the ideologies of voting districts within Massachusetts. The election data will help to identify which political party residents in that district typically vote for. The demographic census data can be used to determine predictors of voting patterns within each county and town. We plan to use the county shapes data to build our visualization of voting districts. We also plan to characterize each ballot question ideologically by comparing districts that voted in favor of the ballot question with those that voted for certain party candidates in the same year.

## Additional Python Libraries
You may need to import the following libraries to access our datasets: bs4, pandas, requests, csv, io

They can be installed by running the requirements.txt file

```
pip3 install requirements.txt
```

If you get a 'SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED' error, you need to install certificates for your version of Python. In MacOS, navigate to Finder->Applications->Python3.7 and double click on 'InstallCertificates.command' and then on 'UpdateShellProfile.command'.
